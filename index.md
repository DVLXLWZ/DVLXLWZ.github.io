### About Me
> I’m an undergraduate student who is interested to geometry, more percisely, algebraic geometry (geometrical instead of arithmetical) and the geometry less soft (such as complex geometry).

## Education

> + **2019 —— Now: (Undergraduate) Shandong University ([Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) and [SDU - Taishan Collage](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/));**

> + **2016 —— 2019: (High School) Taiyuan No.2 Foreign Language School;**

## Some Notes About Mathematics
> + [Errata and Notes for Illusie's Topics in Algebraic Geometry](/IllusieErrataNotes.pdf): **(Finished yet at 2022/03/28)** We will fix some typo and errors in this book and take some notes in this file. **I omitted the subsection I.4.14, the section III.4 and the chapter IV!** The original book see [Illusie](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yiouyang/Illusie.pdf).

> + [Review of Basic Algebraic Topology](/SomeAT.pdf):  **(Finished yet at 2022/04/06)** This is a review of basic algebraic topology including the first three chapter of A. Hatcher's book, including fundamental groups, covering spaces, homology and cohomology theory. Moreover we give some proofs of some famous topology theorems, such as Jordan curve theorem, Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem and orientation of compact hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

> + [Some Notes for Goertz and Wedhorn's AGI book 2nd Edition](/AGnotes1.pdf): **(Not finished yet. Update at 2022/02/20)** This is a note which aims to fix some gaps in it. The original book see [UT1](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-658-30733-2.pdf). Its official errata see [Errata and Addenda for Algebraic Geometry I](https://www.algebraic-geometry.de/errata/) (I also upload some errata in this website and this book is very nice).

> + [Spectral Sequences](/SpectralSequence.pdf): **(Finished yet)** This is a note about the basic spectral sequences. We first discuss the spectral sequences of exact couples, filered complexes and double complexes. Moreover, we will make some examples to show how them work. Furthermore, we also introduce Cartan-Eilenberg Resolutions and its most important
application, Grothendieck spectral sequences (We have proved it in the notes!) and its applications such as Leray spectral sequences and so on.

> + [Notes on Basic Complex Geometry](/ComManiBasis.pdf): **(Finished yet, the language is Chinese here)** This notes is about basic Complex Geometry including the most basic Hodge theory, some vanishing theorems, Kodaira’s embedding theorem and Riemann-Roch theorem.

## Undergraduate Research and Summer School
> + **(2021 Summer) 2021 BICMR Summer School on Differential Geometry:** Here is the homepage: [2021 BICMR DG Summer school](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/cn/content/show/17-2464.html). 
>> My grades: (1) Complex Geometry: 100/100;
>> 
>> (2) Riemannian Geometry: 90/100.

> + **(2020.12 – 2021.11) Undergraduate Research about Basic Algebraic Geometry:** (advisor: Yin Hongbo) We learned some basic scheme theory and cohomology and some basic complex geommetry. [Summary](/AGRESKC.pdf).

## Some Seminars I have Taken
> + **(2021 Autumn) Seminar of Algebraic Topology** We discuss the first two chapters of R. Nott and L. W. Tu's Differential Froms in Algebraic Topology. I discussed the section 5 and the half of section 11. Here is my lectures:
>> My Lectures: (1) [Section 5](/2021ATSe1.pdf);
>>
>> (2) [Section 11](/2021ATSe2.pdf).

> + **(2020 Autumn) Seminar of Homological Algebra** We discuss the chapter 5-8 of J.J. Rotman's An Introduction to Homological Algebra. I discuss the section 6.1. Here is my lecture notes: [Section6.1](/2020HASe.pdf).

## Some Courses and Notes I have Taken in SDU
 **Aim to make the younger students more convenience**
 > + **(2022 Spring) Reading and Writing in Mathematics:** (Taught by Prof. Jordan Stoyanov) [Version 1](/Project_1B-Draft1.pdf) **(At 2022/03/28)** My project is
 > **Two-Dimensional Distributions,Marginals and Covariance Structure**.
 
> + **(2022 Spring) Fundamentals in Number Theory:** Here is the homepage: [Homepage of Fundamentals in Number Theory](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/brhuang/zh_CN/zdylm/1454369/list/index.htm)

> + **(2021 Spring) Complex Analysis:**  We mainly use an easy book from China and E. Stein's famous book. My Homeworks of Complex Analysis: [Homeworks of Complex Analysis](/complexanalHWAll.pdf)  **(The language is Chinese here.)**.

> + **(2021 Spring) Algebraic Geometry I:**  In this course we read Ch1.1-Ch1.5 of Hartshorne's book (I think its so difficult). The final grade is based on the students notes about some topics in algebra geometry. My notes: [Basic Hodge Theory on Complex Manifolds](HODGE.pdf) **(The language is English here.)**.

> + **(2021 Spring) Basic Probability Theory:**  My notes: [Basic Probability Theory](/Probability.pdf) **(The language is Chinese here.)**.

> + **(2020 Autumn) Algebra:** Textbook: 'Undergraduate Algebra-3rd Edition' by Serge Lang. My notes about Galois theory: [Basic Galois Theory](/Galois.pdf) **(The language is Chinese here.)**.

> + **(2020 Autumn) ODEs:**  My notes about Basic ODEs: [Review of Basic ODEs](/ODE.pdf)  **(The language is Chinese here.)**. Our midterm exam: [ODEs Midterm](/ODEmid.pdf)  **(The language is Chinese here.)**.

> + **(2020 Autumn) Basic Physics:**  My notes about physics: [Basic Physics I](/Physics1.pdf)  **(The language is English here.)**,[Basic Physics II](/Physics2.pdf)  **(The language is Chinese here.)**.
